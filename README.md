OVER VIEW OF PROJECT
How It Works:

Class Definition:

The Student class is used to store the student's name and grades.
It has methods to add grades, calculate the average grade, determine the letter grade, compute the GPA, and display the student information.

Main Function:

The program prompts the user to input the student's name and grades for different subjects.
The input loop continues until the user enters 'done'.
It validates the grade input to ensure it is between 0 and 100.
After collecting all grades, it calculates and displays the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

Execution:

The program runs the main function, which facilitates interaction with the user to enter data and view the results.
This code provides a simple and interactive way to manage and track student grades in a text-based environment.
